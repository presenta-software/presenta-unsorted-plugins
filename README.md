# PRESENTA Unsorted Plugins

This repository contains Proof-Of-Concept and experimental plugins for **PRESENTA Lib**.

The main purpose is to test new ideas quickly leaving them available pubblicly for easy evaluation.

For that reason, the whole repository is published under this base URL:

```
https://unsorted-presenta-plugins.netlify.app/
```

This means that you can include one or more plugins both in [Playground](https://play.presenta.cc/) tool or within any online coding tool such as [Codepen](https://codepen.io/).

**A word of caution:**

All these plugins have to be considered experimental or proof-of-concept, even if they looks finalized.

A well-structure plugin usually lives in its own repository, ideally alongside a build toolchain, in order to publish a single javscript file that might include external dependencies.
